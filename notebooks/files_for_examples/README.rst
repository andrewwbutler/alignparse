RecA data
---------
Data from Danny Lawrence's deep mutational scanning of RecA:

  - `recA_amplicon.gb <recA_amplicon.gb>`_: PacBio amplicon of RecA

  - `lib-1_ccs.fastq <lib-1_ccs.fastq>`_ and `lib-2_ccs.fastq <lib-2_ccs.fastq>`_: FASTQ files from running PacBio ``ccs``, shortened to include just a handful of entries.

  - `lib-1_report.txt <lib-1_report.txt>`_ and `lib-2_report.txt <lib-2_report.txt>`_: ``ccs`` report files corresponding the the FASTQ files. Manually edited to also have stats for just a handful of entries.
