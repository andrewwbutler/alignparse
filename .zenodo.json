    "description": "<p><code>alignparse</code>&nbsp;is a Python package written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html\">the Bloom lab</a>. It is designed to align long sequencing reads (such as those from PacBio circular consensus sequencing) to targets, filter these alignments based on user-provided specifications, and parse out user-defined sequence features. For each read that passes the filters, information about the features (e.g. accuracy, sequence, mutations) is retained for further analyses.</p>",
